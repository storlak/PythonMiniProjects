## How to use?

ðŸŒŸ Searching a Word

- Select first the language you want to make the search.
- Type any word in selected language in search boxes.
- Use meaning, synonym, antonym to search for the meaning, synonym or antonym of a word.
- Search button or enter key works as well.
- Use copy button to copy your search result.
- Use clear button to clear the search and the result area.
- If you have any questions or suggestions use [Disccusions](https://github.com/storlak/PythonMiniProjects/discussions)
- If the word you're looking for is not in the dictionary search result retrns ([], ",")

ðŸŒŸ Avoid the following while searching!

- Don't add "s", plural in the end of the word. Search returns null.
- If you're searching a verb don't use "to". write "help" instead of "to help"

## Roadmap

- More languages to be added!
- App will be converted to .exe file for windows.
- App will be converted to flatpak and will be published in flathub repo.
- Deb package to be created.

## Known issues

- Search result in any language besides English comes first with English definition. [Issue ticket](https://github.com/storlak/PythonMiniProjects/issues/2) opened to PyMultiDictionary module.
- Tool menu items (switch language) are not functional yet.
