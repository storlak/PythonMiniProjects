## How to use?

ðŸŒŸ Searching a Word

- Select the language you want to search first.
- Type any word in the selected language into the search boxes.
- Use "meaning," "synonym," or "antonym" to search for the meaning, synonym, or antonym of a word.
- The search button or Enter key works as well.
- Use the copy button to copy your search result.
- Use the clear button to clear the search and the result area.
- If you have any questions or suggestions, use [Disccusions](https://github.com/storlak/PythonMiniProjects/discussions).
- If the word you're looking for is not in the dictionary, the search result returns ([], ",").

ðŸŒŸ Avoid the following while searching!

- Don't add "s" at the end of the word. Searches return null.
- If you're searching for a verb, don't use "to". Write "help" instead of "to help".

## Roadmap

- More languages will be added!
- Keyboard shortcuts - uick commands will be revised.
- The app will be converted to an .exe file for Windows.
- The app will be converted to Flatpak and published in the Flathub repository.
- A Deb package will be created.

## Known issues

- Search results in any language besides English come first with the English definition. An issue ticket has been opened to the PyMultiDictionary module. You can view it [here](https://github.com/storlak/PythonMiniProjects/issues/2).
- Tool menu items (switch language) are not functional yet.
